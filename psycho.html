            <p>The song “Psycho” by Red Velvet has a dark and mysterious feel, which can be interpreted in the context of horror. Here are some horror theories that can be attributed to the song. A Toxic Love Story, the lyrics reflect a relationship full of conflict and uncertainty. In the context of horror, it could be interpreted as love that leads to obsession. There may be a supernatural element, where one of the partners is trapped in a dangerous relationship, sacrificing their soul for the sake of toxic love. Life After Death, There is a melancholic feel to the song that can be associated with a trapped soul. Perhaps the narrator is a ghost pining for lost love, trying to contact his loved one, but trapped in a world between life and death. <br>
                Psychological Alienation, This song also describes feelings of alienation and anxiety. In horror theory, it could be that the protagonist has a mental disorder that makes him see scary things that no one else can see. The darkness in his mind leads him into terrible situations. Loss of Identity, Lyrics that reflect uncertainty about the self can describe someone who has lost their identity due to the bad influence of others. <br>
                In the context of horror, there could be an evil being or force that transforms him, sucking the essence of his soul and leaving an unrecognizable figure. Circle of Curses, This song can be considered part of a larger story about curses. Every time someone hears the song, they get caught in the same circle, repeating the same mistakes in their relationship, unable to escape the negative influence that wrong love brings. These theories add a dark layer to the meaning of the song “Psycho,” showing how music can portray different aspects of darkness in human relationships.</p>
